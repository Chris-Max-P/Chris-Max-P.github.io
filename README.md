Hello everybody,

I am a computer scientist 
with experience in the field of a fullstack developer.

I collected my experience while developing various apps and websites
for big companies, private clients, events and friends
using up-to-date web technologies and frameworks.

I created websites and desktop apps using
- pure `HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`
- `Angular` and corresponding component libraries
- `Angular` together with `electron.js`
- integrating `Angular`- and pure `HTML`/`JS`/`CSS`-websites into `WordPress`

Of course, every frontend has a backend.
Backend technologies I work with include
- `Java` with `Spring` or `Spring Boot`
- `Node.js`
- `C#` with `ASP.NET Core`

In order to be able to create beautiful interfaces with a good user experience,
I employ design principles and
think about interaction and information design.
In general, I always have the user in mind when I develop software.

This approach of design thinking is rounded up 
by a good portion of system thinking - 
having the big picture in mind when working on the small ones.
This makes my work very holistic.
